/* 3.	Write a defining table and JavaScript program to check whether a number is Perfect number or not?

Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
For example: 6 is the first perfect number
Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3
Sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Hence 6 is a perfect number.

Def Table
-	Input :  a number
-	Output:  true or false
-	Process
o	Initial a sum to 1 cause 1 always a divisor
o	Loop from 2 to the number â€“ 1
o	In the loop check if the index is a factor ie number % index ===0
o	If so add to sum
o	Finally check to see if sum === number then perfect
*/

const number = 6;
let sum = 1;
for (let i = 2; i < number; i++){
    if (number % i === 0){
        sum = sum + i;
    }
}
if (sum === number){
    console.log("perfect!");
} else {
    console.log("sorry, not perfect :-( ");
}
